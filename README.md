# Smartphone as Webcam
Use the camera in your mobile phone as webcam and stream it in your pc. (I have only tested this code in Android smartphones)

## STEP 1
- You need to install the IP Webcam app. <br> 
- Then open the app and click in "Start Server".<br>
  <sub> It will create a server in your mobile phone through the wifi connection. So to this code work, you need that your PC and your phone to be connected in the same wi-fi network.</sub><br><br>
- Take note from the http URL as shows the blue arrow in the image below

 ## STEP 2
 - With the server running, change the URL you took note in the program <i>AccessPhoneWebcam.py</i>
 - A window will open showing a real time video from your mobile phone camera.
